        Embarking on my journey in 2017, I initially delved into the world of UI
        design. However, my path soon evolved as my passion for design & digital
        art flourished. Today, as an independent designer, I blend together
        expertise in design, development & 3D to craft effective & innovative
        solutions. At the intersection of effective design and visual artistry,
        diverge two distinct paths. On one side, I craft interfaces and web
        designs for brands and companies, striving to achieve meaningful
        outcomes. On the other, I produce visual art for musicians and public
        figures, infusing each piece with metaphorical narratives.
